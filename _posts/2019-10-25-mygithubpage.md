I'm using Mmistakes with Inconsolata font. Here the short note how to make your github page like mine :-

1.  Create and setup your own github page.
2. Git clone your repo to your desktop (or any place in your computer) using your *terminal* or *git bash*. `git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git`.
3. Git clone this page's repo to your desktop (or any place in your computer). `git clone https://github.com/fareedfauzi/fareedfauzi.github.io.git`.
4. In my github page repo (*fareedfauzi.github.io*) on your desktop, do step 5 until 10.
5. Update `_data/navigation.yml` to change your navigation menu.
6. Update `_pages/about.md` about yourself.
7. Delete `_pages/ctfonline.md`, cause it's an option page by me.
8. Remove all post in `_posts/` and make your own.
9. Upload any required images in `assets/`.
10. Edit `_config.yml` with your own desired. Change your configuration, info, images, theme, name and etc.
11. Copy all the files in my Github page repo to your own Github page repo.
12. Run command `git add .` in your repo using your *terminal* or *git bash* to prepare your repo.
13. Run command `git commit -m "any message"`.
14. Run command `git push` and it will ask for username and password.
15. You're **done** now! Cheers üòÅ.
