Assalamualaikum and Hello everyone. Below are the challenges I solved during NanoSec Wargames.my 2019. 

 1. [WebSec101](#WebSec101)
 2. [e-moji](#e-moji)
 3. [notbraille](#notbraille)

Here is the final scoreboard

Ok let's go.

# WebSec101
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/omgeNubYZ4rFjzVMURbvFvYLxBuk7tSAKy9gqKVdwWtTBl76tvTJrxPc5MR03lBiJJrrcdcL-mvp){: .align-center}

Navigate to the webpage will reveal us the home page of the WebSec101.
The page tell us that "*In order to get flag, you need to solve 5 available web security challenges. Flag will automatically shown here after you solve all of it*."

The challenges are consist of 5 levels.

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_V9Xy5q2DnUrDrU8Pem8RDwMIoJB6cZPTmTOUGy5aWLRNeoJ9eq0Z7k6kn4f-553e8d4BGRq6MFA){: .align-center}

Let's do all of it one by one.

**Level 1 -  The Classic**

Change admin's cookies from value "0" to "1".

**Level 2 - The Classic 2**

It's a page with a login form. Viewing the source code will reveal us there is an javascript code called *app.js*. Scrolling down to the bottom of the page source will give us the username and password.

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KAV6VaX7t8tSsBeelGB8YxGJx_snJXn28KnF-yc-w4hdfFgN64IT4JYJzbqmvdJb3K153NpsKDLT){: .align-center}

**Level 3 - May the source be with you**

Again there's a login form in the challenge's papge. Trying the same username and password as level 2 will result us a failure to login. To solve this, just use a basic SQL Injection on the form and the login will success.

Username = *' OR '1'='1*

Password = *[anything]*

**Level 4 - Too Loose to Lost**

The web ask us a question and we need to answer it in the text box.

"Find a string that has a MD5 digest equal to itself!"

So, just Google for the answer!

Answer: *0e215962017*

**Level 5 - Good old friend**

Navigate to the page only display "*Unknown*" text. Then, we navigate to *source.txt* and it give us the source code of php.

Checking out the cookies of the webpage, there is a cookies name *user_info* with value "*s%3A105%3A%22IP+%3D+210.186.114.19+%2C+UA+%3D+Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Windows+NT+10.0%3B+Win64%3B+x64%3B+rv%3A69.0%29+Gecko%2F20100101+Firefox%2F69.0%22%3B*".

Decoding the URL encoded will result us this text.
"*s:105:"IP+=+210.186.114.19+,+UA+=+Mozilla/5.0+(Windows+NT+10.0;+Win64;+x64;+rv:69.0)+Gecko/20100101+Firefox/69.0";*"

s => string,

105 => length of user_info 

*IP+=+210.186.114.19+,+UA+=+Mozilla/5.0+(Windows+NT+10.0;+Win64;+x64;+rv:69.0)+Gecko/20100101+Firefox/69.0* => user_info

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ADuIjRi4rPLwEF-E_md-Yaqri37HCjTlayMZSIoUsEcvFsTJt7Az9_8M4Dpjn2RmSUNESIl0Fvx7){: .align-center}

Looking into the source code reveal us that if we set the cookie info into md5(rempah), we will pass the challenges.

Editing the user_info cookie value to *"s:32:"9b6c5a5486186eff0944e45a45f69ef6";"* (must encode this value first to URL encode) will get us our flag in the home page.

Flag: ***wgmy{bb2f671d9dd705c25da3a70128794c1a}***

# e-moji
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dfJ2-RzaXEZ6eRkf3w24NtMHhIPKsGrf0sb-r69rrIi3JM2ZAjT9qhJbgvUdF8wkOF_toamwI_3l){: .align-center}

So, extract the zip file will gave us these images.

*msg.webp*

*key.webp*

The solution:

 - Go to [https://codemoji.org/#/encrypt](https://codemoji.org/#/encrypt)
 - Create any random dummy message to be encrypt
 - Click "share", they will give us a shortlink that resolves into "*https://codemoji.org/share.html?data=[url and base64 encoded]*".
 - Decode the data and it will give something like this
`{ 
  "message": "👾📢📘💪🐦📢💪☀🌆💪🐸⭐⭐⭐📢📘💪",
  "key": "💪"
}` 
- Replace the dummy message with the given image *(msg.webp*)
- Replace the key with the given key (*key.webp*)
- Encode the message back into the base64.
- Encode the base64 text into url encode.
- Copy and put into data. So it will become like this “_https://codemoji.org/share.html?data=[url and base64 of data encoded]_”.
- Navigate to the link and decipher it by choose emoji like in *key.webp*.

# notbraille

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VrQ26SqqkRmFLo-qUynAsa8IdNd3T5mzXBnKMD-L35VEjLW57uYfymKDX_sMzahFSLvOj2oyfmcw){: .align-center}

Organizer gave us a picture with some unrecognized steganography in it. My initial thoughts were that this looks like braille but the challenge's name clearly tell us that it's not a braille. 

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/neiy6EPXggSZ0h5vkWNJkldWlOCTqR2A4w_XA9yXxs7HZY-pPbWIC_STslFUJz_7xxhiwF9tFi-0){: .align-center}

I reread the challenge's description and realized that the organizer need a "serial number". So, after some research on Google, I found some source explaining about printer steganography which are looks like the picture we downloaded.

If you look closely, it’s pretty similar. All we need to do to find the flag is add up the bits from columns 11 to 14 and read the value from right to left. Which is 29 - 03 - 64 -39. 

So, the answer is *29036439*.
