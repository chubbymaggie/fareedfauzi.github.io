Based on article written by Security Ninja (All credit to him), this note is useful for the common Windows API used by malware developer in making Windows malware. 
So, this note you will learn about the various windows api functions commonly encountered by malware analysts.

 1.   **`Accept`**: This function is used to listen for incoming connections. The accept function permits an incoming connection attempt on a socket. It is mostly used by malware to connect and communicate with attacker Command and Communication server. Refer [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-accept).

```
SOCKET WSAAPI accept( SOCKET s, sockaddr *addr, int *addrlen );
```


 2.   **`AdjustTokenPrivileges`**: The AdjustTokenPrivileges function enables or disables privileges in the specified access token. Enabling or disabling privileges in an access token requires TOKEN_ADJUST_PRIVILEGES access. In a process injection attack, this function is used by malware to gain additional permissions. Refer [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-adjusttokenprivileges).

```
BOOL AdjustTokenPrivileges( HANDLE TokenHandle, BOOL DisableAllPrivileges, PTOKEN_PRIVILEGES NewState, DWORD BufferLength, PTOKEN_PRIVILEGES PreviousState, PDWORD ReturnLength );
```   
    
 3.   **`AttachThreadInput`**:  This function attaches or detaches the input processing mechanism of one thread to that of another thread such as keyboard and mouse events. Keyloggers and other spyware use this function. Refer [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-attachthreadinput).

```
BOOL AttachThreadInput( DWORD idAttach, DWORD idAttachTo, BOOL fAttach);
```
    
 4.   **`Bind`**: This function is used to associate a local address to a socket in order to listen for incoming connections usually for malware listen for CnC connection. Refer [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock/nf-winsock-bind).

```
int bind( SOCKET s, const sockaddr *addr, int namelen );
```

 5.   **`BitBlt`**:  The BitBlt function performs a bit-block transfer of the color data corresponding to a rectangle of pixels from the specified source device context into a destination device context. This function is used to copy graphic data from one device to another. Spyware sometimes uses this function to capture screenshots. Refer [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-bitblt).
```
BOOL BitBlt( HDC hdc, int x, int y, int cx, int cy, HDC hdcSrc, int x1, int y1, DWORD rop );
```
    
 6.   **`CertOpenSystemStore`**: This function is used to access the certificates stored on the local system. Malware commonly uses to steal certificates stored on the victim’s infected computer. Refer [Microsoft docs.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-certopensystemstorea)
```
HCERTSTORE CertOpenSystemStoreA( HCRYPTPROV_LEGACY hProv, LPCSTR szSubsystemProtocol );
```
    
 7.   **`Connect`**: This function is used to connect to a remote socket. The  connect function establishes a connection to a specified socket. It is mostly used by malware to communicate with their Command and Communication server. Refer [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-connect)
```
int WSAAPI connect( SOCKET s, const sockaddr *name, int namelen );
```
    
 8.   **`ConnectNamedPipe`**: This function is used to create a server pipe for interprocess communication that will wait for a client pipe to connect. It enables a named pipe server process to wait for a client process to connect to an instance of a named pipe. A client process connects by calling either the [CreateFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilew) or [CallNamedPipe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-callnamedpipea) function. This function commonly used to create malware backdoors. Refer [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/namedpipeapi/nf-namedpipeapi-connectnamedpipe)
```
BOOL ConnectNamedPipe( HANDLE hNamedPipe, LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped );
```
    
 9.   **`ControlService`**: This function is used to sends a control code to a service. It will use to start, stop, modify, or send a signal to a running service. If malware is using its own malicious service, code needs to be analyzed that implements the service in order to determine the purpose of the call. Refer [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsvc/nf-winsvc-controlservice) 
```
BOOL ControlService( SC_HANDLE hService, DWORD dwControl, LPSERVICE_STATUS lpServiceStatus );
```
    
 10.   **`CreateFile`**: Creates or opens a file or I/O device. The most commonly used I/O devices are as follows: file, file stream, directory, physical disk, volume, console buffer, tape drive, communications resource, mailslot, and pipe. The function returns a handle that can be used to access the file or device for various types of I/O depending on the file or device and the flags and attributes specified. Refer [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea)

```    
 12.   **`CreateMutex`**: This function creates Creates or opens a named or unnamed mutex object. It creates a mutual exclusion object that can be used by malware to ensure that only a single instance of the malware is running on a system at any given time. Malware often uses fixed names for mutexes, which can be good host-based indicators to detect additional installations of the malware. Refer [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-createmutexa)
```
HANDLE CreateMutexA( LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpMutexAttributes, BOOL bInitialOwner, LPCSTR lpName );
```    
 13.   **`CreateProcess`**: The CreateProcess function creates a new process, which runs independently of the creating process. However, for simplicity, the relationship is referred to as a parent-child relationship. If malware creates a new process, new process needs to be analyzed as well. Refer [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/creating-processes)
    
 14.   **`CreateRemoteThread`**: This function is used to creates a thread that runs in the virtual address space of another process. It will start a thread in a remote process. Launchers and stealth malware use CreateRemoteThread to inject code into a different process. Refer [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createremotethread)
```
HANDLE CreateRemoteThread( HANDLE hProcess, LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpThreadAttributes, SIZE_T dwStackSize, LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE lpStartAddress, LPVOID lpParameter, DWORD dwCreationFlags, LPDWORD lpThreadId );
